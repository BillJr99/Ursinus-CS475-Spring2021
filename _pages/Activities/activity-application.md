excerpt: "CS475: Computer Networks - The Application Layer"

info:
  goals: 
    - To describe the functionality of application layer protocols including HTTP and SMTP
    - To implement a multithreaded, multiplexed socket I/O application that implements an application layer protocol

      title: "HTTP"
      questions: 
        - "If a web page contained an image, what would need to happen?  How might this be optimized?  Hint: this optimization is implemented in HTTP/1.1"
        - "What information could be stored to maintain state between requests; that is, to associate a request with a particular user or session?  Why isn't a stateful session mechanism built into HTTP?"
        - "Look up a few HTTP response code numbers.  What pattern do you see?"
        - "What are some HTTP client headers and what do they do?"
        - "How do you upload a file via HTTP?"

      title: "SMTP"
      questions: 
        - "How does a mail client indicate to the server that they are finished sending a message?  What if the sender wishes to transmit that character?"
        - "How might a sender authenticate against the server?"
        - "Where does the sender indicate their email address?  What unfortunate consequence could result from this?"
        - "How might a sender attach a file?"

                SEND DATA packet#
                And send that 512b chunk of the file
